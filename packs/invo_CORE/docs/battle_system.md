# Inner Voices Battle System

## Dodging Modes

* **Float**: You can move the SOUL freely across the screen.

* **Fall**: You can move the SOUL left and right, and ocasionally jump. You also fall in a certain direction.

* **Discrete**: You can move the SOUL, but confined to a checkers-like grid.

* **Snek**: The SOUL -- which looks like a snake -- will move on its own in a grid at regular intervals, and you can move it forward left or right of where it's currently facing, but not straight back.

* **Mirror**: The SOUL will have a twin that mirrors its movement and can also suffer damage. (It can flip the position vertically and/or horizontally.)
